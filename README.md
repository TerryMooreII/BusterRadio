Buster Radio is a redesigned interface for the live music section of Archive.org.  

Currently you can search or list all Artists that have submitted shows. After selecting a show you can click on the plus sign next to a song to add it your playlist or click the add all plus sign to add them all.  THere are tab available to read show reviews or detailed show information.  You can click the heart to save the show in your favorites.  

On the Artist tab you can click the shuffle icon to have the system randomly select an artist so that you can discover new music.  

Some shows dont have MP3 available, soon it will display a link to download that shows .shn files.  

Site also supports some short hand keys for audio player
Play/Pause = p
Next Track = n
Previous Track = b
Mute = m


NOTE:
This only supports the new HTML5 audio element.  I dont have any intension of support a plugin for older browser.  


TODO:
Save playlists and favorites to a database instead of local storage.
Ablitiy to download .shn files.
Fix sound control to support more than just mute/unmute.
and much more that I cant think of right now.  


Name:
Where does the name come?  Its based off the song title Buster by Moe.
