Buster Radio is a redesigned interface for the live music section of Archive.org.  

Currently you can search or list all Artists that have submitted shows. After selecting a show you can click on the plus sign next to a song to add it your playlist or click the add all plus sign to add them all.  THere are tab available to read show reviews or detailed show information.  You can click the heart to save the show in your favorites.  

On the Artist tab you can click the shuffle icon to have the system randomly select an artist so that you can discover new music.  

Some shows dont have MP3 available, soon it will display a link to download that shows .shn files.  

##Keyboard Shortcuts
*Play/Pause = p
*Next Track = n
*Previous Track = b
*Mute = m


##NOTES
This only supports the HTML5 audio element. Since it streams MP3 and doesn't currently have the OGG fallback it only work with Chrome and the Windows version of Firefox.  

##TODO:
*Rework the way you play the files so that you don't have to add them to a playlist first. 
*Save playlists and favorites to a database instead of local storage.
*Ablitiy to download .shn files.
*Fix sound control to support more than just mute/unmute.
*Possible switch to AngularJS.  
*Split up the functionality.  This was meant as a demo that grew in to a side project without orginization.

###Name
Where does the name come?  Its based off the song title Buster by Moe.
